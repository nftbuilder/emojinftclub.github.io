                    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

                    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>

                    <p>This is the privacy policy for Goth Emoji (hereby referred to as "the app"), including the hosting app and the embedded keyboard extension that is installed together with the app. This policy explains how we collect and use data in the app.</p>

                    <p>Whenever this policy mentions "personal data", we refer to any data that directly or indirectly may be used to identify you as an individual. Whenever this policy mentions "anonymous data", we refer to any data that cannot be used to identify you as an individual.</p>

                    <p>This privacy policy may be updated when new features are added to the app, that require changes in how we collect, use and share data. Whenever that happens, we will mention this in the release notes, so that you have the chance to review the updated policy before installing the update.</p>


                    <h3>2. Policy Overview</h3>
                                        
                    <p>In short, this policy states the following:</p>
                                        
                    <ul>
                        <li>The app does not collect any personal data</li>
                        <li>The app only uses the full access feature to copy emojis to the pasteboard</li>
                        <li>We will not sell any data we collect to third parties</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For more details on this, please see the remainder of the document.</p>


                    <h3>3. How we collect data</h3>

                    <p>The app only collects data when you use it to send us suggestions or feedback, using the hosting app. This data is not personal.</p>

                    <p>The keyboard extension does not collect any data. Full access is only used to copy images to the pasteboard, so that you can paste them into your conversation, document etc.</p>


                    <h3>4. How we use your data</h3>

                    <p>We only use the collected, anonymous data to see suggestions and feedback that you have send us, using the hosting app.</p>


                    <h3>5. How we share your data</h3>

                    <p>We only use the collected, anonymous data to see how often the hosting app is used, and what features you have told us you would like to see in the app.</p>


                    <h3>6. How we communicate with you</h3>

                    <p>We only use the collected, anonymous data to decide what to develop next. Any need to communicate any work carried out as a result of this collected data is handled in the release notes, when releasing a new version of the app.</p>


                    <h3>7. How we share your information</h3>

                    <p>We will not share your personal data with any third party unless you have given us permission. We may share anonymized data, where we have removed any personal data, with other parties. One example is Google Analytics, which is used to collect feedback and suggestions.</p>
